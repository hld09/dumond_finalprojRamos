                           <p>Lauren’s mission for her account is “to inspire people to get out and see the world, and for
                             those who can’t travel for whatever reason, to be able to take them around the world.”
                             Her goal is to be unique and inspirational by creating “a realistic vision of our lives
                             and travelling, a combination of showing the destination, including us in the images,
                             the culture, food, and hotels.” Her account recently just reached 2 million followers,
                              a huge milestone she said she was proud to reach.

                               <p>Photographer Charles Pétillon (previously) captures arranged configurations of balloons in a variety of environments—trapping the illuminated organic shapes momentarily in his photographs. The huddles of balloons are metaphors for Pétillon, a nod to the objects, buildings, and structures we often pass by in our busy lives without taking the time to really notice them. Last year he produced a 177-foot-long installation for London’s Covent Garden, a work that he titled Heartbeat.

                                   <p>Ellie’s mission is “to encourage people to live a wholesome life” by sharing healthy
                                     plant-based recipes, tools to cook wholesome food, and colorful photos to inspire others

                                       Roughly four years ago, she created her blog (not long after Instagram) and learned
                                        that her followers wanted her recipes - so she started sharing them on her website.
