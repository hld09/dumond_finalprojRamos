			<h3> ABOUT </h3>
			<br>
		<center>
<p>	We live in a modern age where everything we do, create, and say has the potential to go viral.. in an instant, in what could almost be considered insta-instant. Our individuality and creative expression has been funneled into a myriad of social media platforms, meant to show off, gloat, and wave our lives in the faces of both those we know and those we don’t. We create, express, and show off what we are wearing, where we are eating, the nicest flatlays and most beautiful spaces for the sake of likes, followers, and other forms of boosting engagement numbers on our social media platforms. <br><br>
This is a conference for creatives… for designers, for makers, for doers. This is a conference where fellow creatives dissect what it means when they say that life imitates art, reflects art, and ultimately serves as the inspiration for creating art. This is a conference for those interested in what it means to be a creative in our present digital stratosphere, desperately seeking our own places and niches within the carefully curated Instagram feeds of strangers and friends alike. Design thinking does not stop with graphic design or the perfected user interface designs of the social apps we use to stay connected, it has begun to extend to every facet of our lives. When was the last time you went to a restaurant and didn’t whip out your phone to take a photo? When was the last time you saw a concert and failed to take a video on your iPhone? When was the last time you went someplace beautiful and refused to take a photo just to show off to your friends? What does it mean to create when everything is staged, perfectly aligned, and ultimately designed for our mass consumption? <br><br>
This is a conference for creatives in the present day. Sign up today to watch and learn from leaders in fields ranging from interior design to branding and creative planning. This is a conference for everyone who considers themselves a creative.
